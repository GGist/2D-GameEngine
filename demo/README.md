Demo
====
About:
------
This demo will show you how to use my 2D-GameEngine. It includes a level editor and a way to run the level you 
created. A save feature has not been implemented so you can only run levels you have just created. This should be
easy enough to implement if you were to want one though.

Controls:
---------
***Level Editor:***<br \>
**Left Mouse** button to place objects<br \>
**Scroll Wheel** to move through the level<br \>
**Spacebar** to toggle enemy/tile<br \>
**Esc** to exit

***Demo Game***<br \>
**W A S D** to move left right up and down<br \>
**Right Mouse** button to shoot<br \>
**Left Mouse** button to knife<br \>
**Spacebar** to deploy parachute<br \>
**Esc** to exit<br \>
